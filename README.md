# Amazon-Product-Reviews---Sentiment-Analysis
This project was done to examine sentiments and keywords over time in order to understand the customers satisfaction and to understand Important factors that influence people's decisions to purchase or recommend level.

<H2> Problem statement</H2>

Reviews tell what products and features are trending, what is in demand, what is no longer relevant, how products and those of competitors are doing, and much more.
It is observed that the maximum number of customers look at product reviews before they make a purchase. Survey results show that positive product reviews are a key factor for purchasing by 57 percent of Amazon buyers (Statista, 2019).

As product reviews are often the deciding factor for many customers, it’s very important to have a well-automated system for monitoring them.
The traditional manual process of Amazon product reviews is time-consuming and inefficient when millions of reviews are being posted all the time. It doesn’t show any trend or patterns over time. Moreover, it is tough to understand customers’ sentiment towards any product or its delivery. 


<H2>Approach </H2>

Understanding the sentiment of reviews in one word and help to built whole story. Therefore, classification of reviews is important to analyze the sentiment.
So, we have an automated system which can classify reviews sentiment into positive, negative and neutral with 85-86% accuracy. 
To basically make a collection of data points based on similarity and dissimilarity between them clustering was performed.
To observe the fluctuations of the negative reviews over a period Time series analysis was done on Micro ( top product that recieved negative reviews) and Macro (On all negative reviews).
